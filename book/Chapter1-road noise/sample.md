Tire load and inflation pressure:  For typical passenger car radial tires, noise increases by 1-2 dB(A) per doubling of load, provided that the inflation pressure is adjusted to the load. If the pressure is not adjusted, the increase is about 0.7-1.5 dB(A) per doubling of load. ​

​

Tire cornering: When a vehicle moves on a horizontal curve, its tires are subject to radial forces due to the cornering movement. ​

For car tires straight driving makes less noise than cornering driving. ​
