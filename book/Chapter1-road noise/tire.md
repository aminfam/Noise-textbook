On board sound intensity (OBSI): Sound intensity test method. Describes the flow of sound energy from a sound source. Unlike sound test level, intensity measurements only capture the sound produced by the noise source under measurement, eliminating the interruption from other sound sources. ​

The system measures the sound intensity at defined locations near the tire pavement interface using phase matched microphones wearing wind screens. ​
