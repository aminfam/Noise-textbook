# Learning objectives, activities and assessment ðŸ’¡

## Learning objectives
At the end of the statics part of this module, you will.
be able to:
LO1: Identify grand challenges in atmospheric environmental engineering related to sustainability of the built environment and to human health. (ILO: b)

LO2: To translate these problems into scientific research and/or engineering questions. (ILO: b)

LO3: Select the appropriate scientific tools (theoretical/ observational/ numerical) to address those questions and become cognizant of the limitations of the chosen tools. (ILO: a)

LO4: Apply various scientific tools in a rigorous and efficient manner. (ILO: e, f)

LO5: Plan, monitor and manage a project and to collaborate in an interdisciplinary team with people from diverse backgrounds. (ILO: j, k)

LO6: Develop novel ideas for interventions; existing knowledge is critically assessed, and alternatives are sought for by integrating multi-disciplinary approaches. (ILO: c)

LO7: Reflect on the societal impact of interventions and be able to discuss ethical aspects of those within the context of atmospheric environment engineering. (ILO: l)

LO8: Effectively communicate research findings to other researchers, engineers, as well as to the general public. (ILO: i)

LO9: Demonstrate understanding of the following UN sustainable development goals: (a) good health and well-being; (b) affordable and clean energy; (c) sustainable cities and communities; and (d) climate action. (ILO: h)
The matrix method for statics is part of the unit 2 of the course CIEM5000 Base: Structural Engineering.


## Learning activities
In this submodule, you'll have two lectures where we cover the content. This book represents the content of those lectures in [](lecture1.md) and [](lecture2.md) 

Next to that, you'll work on applying the content in two workshops. The assignments as part of these workshops are not-graded. This book represents the content of those workshops in [](workshop1.md) and [](workshop2.md).

Additional assignment are available to work on, which you should be able to make after finishing the workshops. These are available in [](additional.md).

On Thursdays in week 7 and 8 there'll be question hours for the full CIEM5000 module. During these you'll have the opportunity to ask questions on this submodule too.

## Assessment
The learning will be assessed with one assignment provided to you after the second workshops. It is shown in [](assignment.md).

This assignment is part of the Assignment Portfolio of unit 2, where it counts for 33%. This portfolio will account for 20% of your total grade of CIEM5000.

The deadline of the assignment is April 18th, 23:59, although you're encouraged to finish it directly after completing workshop 2. Doing so allows you to split the workload evenly.

You can take the resit of this assignment in Q4. If you choose to do so, you can improve your first submission. The deadline of the resit is June 20th, 23:59.

The assignment is graded according to the following rubric:

:::

The assignment is not made under surveillance. You are allowed to collaborate, but you'll need to hand in your own work. You'll have to submit your work to a personal GitHub repository.

Feedback for the assignment will be provided via Brightspace.
