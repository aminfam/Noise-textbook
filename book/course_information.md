# Learning objectives, activities and assessment ðŸ’¡

## Learning objectives
At the end of the noise mitigation and modelling part of this module, you show to be able to:
1.	Translate the main steps of the matrix method into a set of programming classes with distinct tasks
2. Extend the classes to solve arbitrarily complex frame problems in statics
3. Postprocess the analyses and recover continuum fields exactly

The matrix method for statics is part of the unit 2 of the course CIEM5000 Base: Structural Engineering.

## Learning activities
In this submodule, you'll have three lectures where we cover the content. This book represents the content of those lectures in [](lecture1.md) and [](lecture2.md) 

Next to that, you'll work on applying the content in your group project. This book represents the content of your project in [](assignment.md).

Additional readings are available to work on, These are available in [](additional.md).

## Assessment
Noise Modelling and Mitigation: group assignment (presentation of the case study (10%) and report on it (10%)) Both the report and the presentation are group components. Free riding will be prevented as follows:

All group members will be asked to present part of their group assignment. After the presentation of the group assignment, the assessor will ask each individual member of the group specific questions regarding the report and the presentation. Questions can span the whole assignment regardless of which part is presented by the individual group member. This way individual contributions to the group work will be assessed and differentiation of the grades (between group members) will be possible based on the answers provided. It is also shown in [](assignment.md).


The deadline of the assignment is XXXX, 23:59,

You can take the resit of this assignment at the end of Q4. If you choose to do so, you can improve your first submission. The deadline of the resit is XXXXXX

The assignment is graded according to the following rubric:
