# Learning objectives, activities and assessment ðŸ’¡

## Learning objectives
At the end of the noise mitigation and modelling part of this module, you show to be able to:
LO1: Identify grand challenges in atmospheric environmental engineering related to sustainability of the built environment and to human health. (ILO: b)

LO2: To translate these problems into scientific research and/or engineering questions. (ILO: b)

LO3: Select the appropriate scientific tools (theoretical/ observational/ numerical) to address those questions and become cognizant of the limitations of the chosen tools. (ILO: a)

LO4: Apply various scientific tools in a rigorous and efficient manner. (ILO: e, f)

LO5: Plan, monitor and manage a project and to collaborate in an interdisciplinary team with people from diverse backgrounds. (ILO: j, k)

LO6: Develop novel ideas for interventions; existing knowledge is critically assessed, and alternatives are sought for by integrating multi-disciplinary approaches. (ILO: c)

LO7: Reflect on the societal impact of interventions and be able to discuss ethical aspects of those within the context of atmospheric environment engineering. (ILO: l)

LO8: Effectively communicate research findings to other researchers, engineers, as well as to the general public. (ILO: i)

LO9: Demonstrate understanding of the following UN sustainable development goals: (a) good health and well-being; (b) affordable and clean energy; (c) sustainable cities and communities; and (d) climate action. (ILO: h)


## Learning activities
In this submodule, you'll have three lectures where we cover the content. This book represents the content of those lectures in [](lecture1.md) and [](lecture2.md) 

Next to that, you'll work on applying the content in your group project. This book represents the content of your project in [](assignment.md).

Additional readings are available to work on, These are available in [](additional.md).

## Assessment
Noise Modelling and Mitigation: group assignment (presentation of the case study (10%) and report on it (10%)) Both the report and the presentation are group components. Free riding will be prevented as follows:

All group members will be asked to present part of their group assignment. After the presentation of the group assignment, the assessor will ask each individual member of the group specific questions regarding the report and the presentation. Questions can span the whole assignment regardless of which part is presented by the individual group member. This way individual contributions to the group work will be assessed and differentiation of the grades (between group members) will be possible based on the answers provided. It is also shown in [](assignment.md).


The deadline of the assignment is XXXX, 23:59,

You can take the resit of this assignment at the end of Q4. If you choose to do so, you can improve your first submission. The deadline of the resit is XXXXXX

The assignment is graded according to the following rubric:

The assignment is not made under surveillance. You are allowed to collaborate, but you'll need to hand in your own work. You'll have to submit your work to a personal GitHub repository.

Feedback for the assignment will be provided via Brightspace.
