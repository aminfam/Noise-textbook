## Interactive features
This TeachBook includes interactive coding features! Click {fa}`rocket` --> {guilabel}`Live Code` on the top right corner of interactive page to start up a python-kernel in your browser! Any interactions you do here are not stored. You can also download those pages as a notebook to apply the content on your own computer. For the practice exercises this book shows a preview of the notebooks and py-files. These pages allow you to test the functionality. However, please fork and clone the assignment to work on it locally from [GitHub](https://github.com/CIEM5000-2025/practice-assignments). This allows you to edit multiple files simultaneously and save your work.

## Spot a mistake?
If you spot any mistakes, you can click on {octicon}`mark-github;1em` --> {fa}`lightbulb`, login with a GitHub account and report your issue. It'll be solved soon!

## Personalised book
If you'd like to make this TeachBook more personal by adding (private or public) annotations I can recommend the [Hypothesis extension](https://web.hypothes.is/start/). This is only for your own use, I won't monitor public post on this platform.

## Version
This is the `2024-2025`-version of the TeachBook. Updates during this course are communicated on the relevant pages and in [the changelog](./changelog.md). After each of the workshops, updates will follow containing the solutions to the practice exercises.

## Offline book
If you'd like to have an offline version of this book, you can download it by clicking [{fa}`book`](https://ciem5000-2025.github.io/book/_static/book.zip) on the top right corner. Note that some interactive features will not work (for example, the Python code). You can always download separate pages by clicking the {fa}`download` button on any page.
